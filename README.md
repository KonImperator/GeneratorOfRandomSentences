# GeneratorOfRandomSentences
A program that generates random sentences for fun that may not make too much sense, made with JS/Node

Screenshot of how it works ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103381077/202317778-8a80ae2d-d739-462c-b9f9-71401dca5656.png)


Live demo - https://replit.com/@KonImperator/GeneratorOfRandomSentences#rng.js - Just type node rng.js in shell to run and press Enter to generate a new sentence

Done with several arrays holding different types of word/phrases:
names (name of the person)
places (place where action is taking place)
adverbs (how the person is doing the action)
verbs (what the person is doing)
nouns (the obejct being acted upon)
details (additional details at the end)

All of this is then set to variables, combined in a string and ultimately printed together
